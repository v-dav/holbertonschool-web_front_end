# :desktop_computer: Web Front-end Learning Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my Front End Web Learning journey repository at Holberton School. During this journey, I've gained a solid foundation in front-end development skills, covering HTML and CSS.

## Repository Content

This repository contains all the projects and exercises I've undertaken throughout my journey. Each folder represents a specific project and contains its own README file with more details about the project.

## Technologies Used

Here are the technologies that I've learned and used throughout my journey:

- HTML5: I learned to structure web pages and use semantic HTML elements for better SEO and accessibility.
  
- CSS3: I learned to style web pages and use modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
  
- Git and GitHub: I used Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration on projects.
